# Projects

This is where all of my personal/work projects will go

# discordbot
- This will be a music bot, I decided to restart it from scratch and create my bot as a class which I've made into a cog
- Things I've learned:
    - Asynchronous functions
    - Learning python language as I work on this
    - nvm lost all motivation, not finishing this, got bored with python/just creating this bot was very uninteresting to me, I will probably create a python based project later on

# Passwordgen
- Password generator with a gui
- First time using JFrame, and other java gui tools
- Predefined set of characters to choose from, creates a 10 character long string that includes numbers, letters, and symbols

# Text Editor
- Will start out as something similar to notepad, planning to expand this into something more complex later on
- Will contain the basic options & settings:
    - File options, Editing options, Fonts(Maybe?), customizable layouts (TBD)
    - It would be cool if I could turn this into a more robust IDE later on (Build tools, etc)
